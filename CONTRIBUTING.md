First off, thank you for considering contributing to Relxd. It's people like you that make Relxd such a great tool.

The following are guidelines on how you can contribute to the Relxd project. These are not rules but are just guidelines upon which you can use your own discretion and feel free to propose any changes to this document in a pull request.

Contributions we are looking for
Relxd is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Relxd itself.

 Contributions we are not looking for
Please, don't use the issue tracker for [support questions]. Check whether the #lxd channel on Slack can help with your issue. Stack Overflow is also worth considering.

 Ground Rules
Responsibilities

Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.

Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements in this checklist:[--Link to checklist--]

Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.

Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.

Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the Code of Conduct.

Your first Contribution
Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free series, How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub.

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first 

 Getting Started
For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:
Create your own fork of the code

Do the changes in your fork

If you like the change and think the project could use it: * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project. * Sign the Contributor License Agreement, CLA, with the Relxd Foundation. * Note the Relxd Foundation Code of Conduct. * Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file.

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a CLA.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:

Spelling / grammar fixes

Typo correction, white space and formatting changes

Comment clean up

Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants

Adding logging messages or debugging output

Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.

Moving source files from one directory or package to another

How to report a bug
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email given@competitionlabs.com instead.

Any security issues should be submitted directly to given@competitionlabs.com In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?

Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at given@competitionlabs.com.

 

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

What version of Java are you using (java version)?

What operating system and processor architecture are you using?

What did you do?

What did you expect to see?

What did you see instead? General questions should go to the CL-lxd mailing list instead of the issue tracker. The gophers there will answer or ask you to file an issue if you've tripped over a bug.

How to suggest a feature or enhancement
If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Relxd , you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Relxd has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

 Code Review Process
The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a weekly triage meeting that we hold in a public Google Hangout. The hangout is announced in the weekly status updates that are sent to the Relxd dev list. Notes are posted to the Relxd Community community-triage repo and include a link to a YouTube recording of the hangout. After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

 Community
You can chat with the core team on the Slack channel #lxd. We try to have office hours on Fridays.
