List of operations

### Example
```java
// Import classes:
import org.relxd.lxd.ApiClient;
import org.relxd.lxd.ApiException;
import org.relxd.lxd.Configuration;
import org.relxd.lxd.auth.*;
import org.relxd.lxd.models.*;
import org.relxd.lxd.api.OperationsApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://lxd.com");
    
    // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: authentication
    OAuth authentication = (OAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("authentication");
    authentication.setAccessToken("YOUR ACCESS TOKEN");

    OperationsApi apiInstance = new OperationsApi(defaultClient);
    Integer recursion = 56; // Integer | To optimize queries of large lists, recursion is implemented for collections. The default value is 0 which means that collection member URLs are returned. Setting it to 1 will have those URLs be replaced by the object they point to (typically a dict).
    String filter = "filter_example"; // String | There is no default value for filter which means that all results found will be returned. The language follows the OData conventions for structuring REST API filtering logic. Logical operators are also supported for filtering: not(not), equals(eq), not equals(ne), and(and), or(or). Filters are evaluated with left associativity. Values with spaces can be surrounded with quotes. Nesting filtering is also supported.
    try {
      GetOperationsResponse result = apiInstance.getOperations(recursion, filter);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling OperationsApi#getOperations");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());
      System.err.println("Reason: " + e.getResponseBody());
      System.err.println("Response headers: " + e.getResponseHeaders());
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
```
